# Week 1: Game Selection Phase 1

During this week, our game selection process began. Our goal is to create a game that calls back to classic games in the past but brings another level of fun, freshness and challenges. Therefore, it was important for each member in the group to bring together 2 already existing games each, with their added twist to them. In our meeting, it was our responsibility to discuss potential development challenges we, as developers, could face during production. A summary of some of our game ideas are listed below with their brief description. 

| Game          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tetris        | Tetris begins with an empty screen, and requires the player to fit falling blocks together. <br> **- Twist:** there will be two players competing against each other, player 1 will have the ability to change the shape of the blocks falling in player 2's screen, vice versa. <br> **- Development Challenges:** server creation; check matching and deletion of blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bounce        | The original bounce game is a platform game revolving around the player controlling a red ball and navigating through levels and obstacles.. <br> **- Twist:** Imagine a new bounce game where the maps includes different terrain such as water, wind, and ice. <br> **- Development Challenge:** hard coding multiple maps of the game with different game objects and their properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Flappy Bird   | The premise of Flappy Bird's endless runner game is simple: tap the screen to navigate a bird character object through the gaps between pipes without hitting them. <br> **- Twist:** the addition of different weather and terrain can add combinations of wind, rain, obstacles and power ups, affecting the birds movement. <br> **- Development Challenges:** developing different movement mechanics according to different weather types.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Snake Game    | In the game of Snake, the player usually use the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. <br> **- Twist:** Imagine a board where every 30 seconds, sections of the floor fall and the snake has to traverse the map without falling. <br> **- Development Challenges:** random map generator for map generation; adding new parts of the snake at the tail.                                                                                 |
| Doodle Jump   | In the classic Doodle Jump game, player must guide a creature up an endless series of platforms without falling out of the screen. <br> **- Twist:** Imagine a doodle jump game where there is a color instruction that you must follow for the platform you must land next. <br> **- Development Challenge:** generating new platforms at random location at specific distance from each other at the top of the screen, at the same time being in-synced with the color instruction.                                                                                                                 |
| Cat vs Dog    | This game is an entertaining game in which these two characters, a cat and a dog, they will face each other in a battle throwing things at each other. <br> **- Twist:** characters randomly shrink every set amount of time, making it harder to target accurately. <br> **- Development Challenge:** programming the character being paused when it is hit; character shrinking mechanics.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Temple Run    | In Temple Run, the player steers the explorer across a maze, avoiding obstacles while also collecting coins, the longer the explorer survives the higher the score. <br> **- Twist:** during gameplay the direction of the run go reverse mode. <br> **- Development Challenges:** 3D modelling of the map; storing data for game objects to allow reverse mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Breakeout     | The classic Breakout Video Game uses a single ball where the player must knock own as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. <br> **- Twist:** add treasures within the blocks that once knock down, they can be used for power ups. <br> **- Development Challenge:** ball mechanics and collision handling for multiple balls.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Crossy Road   | Crossy Road has been one of the more recent fan favourite arcade hopper. The chicken collect custom characters to be used and navigate freeways, railroads, rivers while avoiding cars. <br> **- Twist:** Imagine, a crossy road game where you not only cross the road from one to the next but also move along into the direction of where the car is moving towards, pushing you to new environments. <br> **- Development Challenges:** frontend constraints for designing objects; programming a large amount of game object mechanics, generating adaptive environments for different obstacles. |
| Tower Defence | The goal of tower defence is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers or by stopping enemies from reaching the exit by placing defensive structures along their path of attack. <br> **- Twist:** Imagine each tower has no weapons of its own, but it granted unique abilities by adding gems to the tower, allowing to give it a different power depending upon which combination you use. <br> **- Development Challenge:** generating wave function for enemies and how they interact with different tower abilities.                                    |

# Week 3: Game Selection Phase 2: Two Prototype Ideas
### **Take Aim** <br>
* Take Aim is a dynamic 1-2 player action game that emphasizes precise movement and strategic combat. Players compete to be the first to reduce their opponent’s Health to 0%, requiring quick reflexes and tactical decision-making. The game features character and map selection, allowing for varied playstyles and environments. At the start of each match, weapons drop from above within the first three seconds, setting the stage for intense battles. Players navigate the map using fluid movement—running, jumping (Up), and shooting (Space)—while avoiding hazards like moving walls. More mechanics and features were under discussion.

### **Tank Duel** <br>
* *Tank Duel is a combat game where two players (or a player vs AI) take turns firing projectiles at each other. Each turn, the player controls a rotating aim that moves between a defined angle range (-X° to Y°) and a power bar that determines the shot’s strength. The objective is to reduce the opponent’s HP to zero by accurately hitting their tank with missiles.
Shots deal different amounts of damage based on where they land: 1)A critical Hit: A direct hit on the tank's head deals extra damage. 2)A normal Hit: A hit anywhere else does standard damage.
Players must carefully time their shot to optimize both angle and power for maximum effectiveness. The game can be played  against an AI opponent with varying difficulty levels and the first player to deplete the opponent's HP wins the match

- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

# 3. Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

| Stakeholder | Epic | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | 
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| User: Retro/Arcade Lovers | Fullfill Player Enjoyment | "As a retro/arcade game lover, I want to play a classic game where I can customise the look of the players and display so that I can relive my favorite gaming experiences in a way that suits my preferences and enhances my enjoyment." | Given I am on the main menu, when I start game, then I should be able to change the player’s look to something like Pacman. |
| User: Casual Gamers | Implement Tutorial for Game Instructions + Pause Function | "As a casual gamer, I want the game instructions/rules to be very clear, and the visual design should be straight-forward. Also, I need to pause the game whenever I want." | Before the game starts, add a short interactive tutorial, then I can fully understand the game. Also, I should see a pause button function. |
| User: Competitive Gamers | Implement Multiplayer Mode | "As a gamer that is extremely competitive, I want to play against my friends so that I have bragging rights when I win” | "On the main menu page, when I navigate to the game mode page, then I should see an option for multiplayer game. | 
| User: Interactive Gamers | Implement Fast-paced in Game Activity | “As an interactive gamer, I want to be able to have different features, like weapons, available in-game so that the game feels different every time." | During the game I need new weapons to be spawned every few seconds and previous weapons to be discarded after a certain amount of time. |
| User: Gamers with Disability | Enhance Visual Accesibility | “As a user with low visibility, I want to be able to see my player and in game activity to be interactive” <br> <br> “As a user with low visibility, I want to be able to resize the text of the main menu” | Given during gameplay, when a player is being hit, then I want to be able to clearly see this with bright and big colors or hear this action. <br> <br> Given during the main menu page, when I navigate to the setting page, then I should see an option for resizing text. |
| Developers: Frontend | Improve UX in Game | "As a player, I want the graphical interface to be visually appealing and less straining on my eyes, so that I can play for longer periods without discomfort." | The UI should use less saturated colors to reduce eye strain. <br> Implement sound and visual effects for player actions (e.g., button clicks, attacks, game events). <br> Ensure that all game menus and interfaces are easy to navigate. <br> Transitions and animations should be smooth and visually engaging. |
| Developers: Backend | Improve UX in Game | "As a player, I want the game to respond smoothly to my actions so that I can enjoy a seamless gaming experience." | Optimize server response time to reduce lag and delays. <br> Ensure that real-time player actions (e.g., shooting, movement, interactions) are processed instantly. <br> Implement efficient database queries to speed up data retrieval and updates. <br> Expand game content by adding more map designs and increasing the variety of available weapons. |
| Developers: Quality Testers | Prototype Quality Assurance | "As a tester, I want to check the movement mechanics of the playable character so that the character moves as it is desired." | **Movement Controls:** <br> The character can move forward, backward, left, and right using the designated input controls (e.g., keyboard). The character's movement speed and responsiveness are consistent. <br> <br> **Jump Mechanics:** <br> The character can jump to a specified height and distance. <br> <br> **Collision Detection:** <br> The character does not pass through obstacles or walls. <br> Collision with objects is accurately detected, and appropriate reactions (e.g., stopping) are triggered. <br> <br> **Environmental Interaction:** <br> The character can interact with the environment (e.g., climb on top of the platform) as specified. <br> <br> **Performance:** <br> The character's movement does not cause any crashes or major bugs in the game. |
| Developers: Dev Ops Lead | Ensure Game is Operating Smoothly | "As a Dev Ops Lead, I want to implement scalable and automated monitoring and logging solutions, so that I can ensure the system is consistently accessible and performing well for all users, including those with disabilities." | Given I am monitoring the system, when I observe the logs and alerts, then I should be able to quickly identify and resolve any accessibility or performance issues, ensuring the best experience for all users, including those with disabilities. |
| Developers: Scrum Master | Initiating Game Development Planning and Finalisation | "As a Scrum Master, I must decide the roles of each Team Member so that I can assign tasks accordingly." | **Role Clarification:** <br> Each team member understands their role and responsibilities. <br> <br> **Task Assignment:** <br> Tasks are assigned to team members based on their roles and expertise. Each task has a clear description, due date, and expected outcome. <br> <br> **Task Tracking:** <br> The progress of each task is regularly updated by the assigned team member. <br> <br> **Communication:** <br> Regular communication is maintained among team members to discuss task progress and resolve any issues. <br> <br> **Sprint Planning:** <br> Sprint planning meetings are conducted to review and assign tasks for each sprint. <br> The Scrum Master ensures that the team's workload is balanced and achievable within the sprint. <br> <br> **Review and Feedback:** <br> Regular review meetings are conducted to assess task completion and gather feedback. <br> The team is encouraged to provide constructive feedback to improve future task assignments. <br> <br> **Documentation:** <br> All assigned tasks, roles, and responsibilities are documented and accessible to the team. <br> Updates to roles and tasks are documented and communicated promptly. | 
| Game Testers | Ensure Feedback is More Categorized to Improve Game Design | "As a game trial player, I want to know what's the difference between this game and others, make it simple to understand and play with, so I can provide feedback on its enjoyment and playability." | Before the game, I need a prototype video to understand the whole game. <br> Also, after the game, provide me with a form of feedback categorized with usability, enjoyment and difficulty so you can clearly know how I feel about the game. |
